            <p class="para">As we all know that the front work area or meeting room can regularly be probably the most
              active spot in
              any business, with staff, guests and workers coming in with their queries, deliveries etc. It's
              troublesome to monitor these movements and the time it takes for a guest to sign the entry book and other
              required desk work, it erases those incredible initial feelings that you might want your guest to have.

        <div class="para">
          <p class="text-center">Adding to that, guests frequently stand by while your support staff finds the
            individual they're here to see. Sadly, this entire process of paperwork comes in the way and you do not
            get enough time to interact with the guest and make them feel welcomed.</p>
          <p class="text-center">With Breazie you can make sure that you focus on your guest more rather than focusing
            on
            paperwork. All you have to do is ask the visitor to scan the code and fill in the details, meanwhile you can
            prepare to give them a warm greeting and make sure that their time is respected. The app will also notify
            the
            member of the team that their guest has arrived, so there is no hustle of finding the person manually. The
            details filled in by the visitor will automatically get listed in the database without any scare data
            getting
            misplaced.</p>
